Write the command to merge “feature-branch” into “master” while providing a custom commit message for the merge.

To merge “feature-branch” into “master” and provide a custom commit message, you can use the following command:

git merge feature-branch -m "Your custom commit message"
Replace “Your custom commit message” with the actual message you want to use for the merge commit. This command performs the merge and creates a new commit on the “master” branch with the specified message. If there are no conflicts, Git will complete the merge automatically.

If conflicts occur during the merge, Git will pause and prompt you to resolve the conflicts manually. After resolving conflicts, you can continue the merge process with:

git merge --continue
Alternatively, you can use an interactive merge to modify the commit message before finalizing the merge:

git merge feature-branch --no-ff -e
This opens an editor where you can edit the commit message before completing the merge. Again, replace “feature-branch” with the name of your actual feature branch.
